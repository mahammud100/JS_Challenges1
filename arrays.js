//code an array of 10 elements of type string (for example 10 students)

let student= ["john", "Layland", "Ali", "Liban", "Fatima", "Noora", "Hidaya", "Bilal"]
//write a loop that iterates through each elements and prints each element

for(let i=0;i<student.length;i++) {
    console.log(students[i])
}
//name few functions that come with arrays, that allows you to interate through the elements

//students.forEach()
//students.map()
//students.filter()
//students.reduce()


//implements forEach function that prints all elements of the array below

//students.forEach(
    //function(value,index){
        //console.log("the elements is "+ value +"and its index is"+ index)
